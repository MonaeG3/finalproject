Struggles – (Short Synopsis of Challenges during First few Weeks) 
There will be three sections in which I explain in dept my experience
Breastfeeding/pumping and bottle feeding.

When my daughter was born, I did not have the chance to bond as she had to be examined then taken to the NICU. As this occurred, 
I feel it played an immense role on me being able to breastfeed. 
Since then, I have struggled with getting her to latch. She prefers a bottle as I believe has a faster flow in which she desires. 
Pumping came as a challenge. 
Bottle feeding preference.
